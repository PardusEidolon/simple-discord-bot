# Simple example discord-bot
A very simple discord bot using the discord.js api

The `config.json` is not pushed due to security reason. I understand the fact that this is just a throw-away bot and mostly just used as an example but its good practice not to compromise a token for obvious reasons.


## Config structure for reference

```json
{
    "token": "your bot's unique token Id located in the bot tap in the discord developer portal",
    "clientId": "your username Id",
    "guildId": "your server Id"
}
```
