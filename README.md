# Simple example discord-bot
A very simple discord bot using the discord.js api

The `config.json` is not pushed due to security reason. I understand the fact that this is just a throw-away bot and mostly just used as an example but its good practice not to compromise a token for obvious reasons.


## Config structure for reference

NOTE: one must enable `Developer mode` under user settings `advanced`

```json
{
    "token": "your bot's unique token Id located in the bot tap in the discord developer portal under the menu `bot`", 
    "clientId": "your username Id",// copied from the three dots under 'my account' 
    "guildId": "your server Id" // copied by right clicking on the server name
}
```
